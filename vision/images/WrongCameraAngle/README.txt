This image set was taken with the camera on a stick.
The 2 and 3pt golas are at the appropriate height, but the camera is
  tilted at too low of an angle. This causes the targets to be higher
  in the frame than desired.
The targets should be roughly in the middle of the frame (vertically)
  when the robot is backed against the pyramid.
